# üîß MetaForge

**MetaForge** is a modular Python toolkit for solving **Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP)** using classic **metaheuristics** and modern **reinforcement learning** methods.

üöÄ From Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Neuroevolution ‚Äî MetaForge brings together the best of optimization and AI in one clean, extensible framework.

## üéØ Key Features

- ‚úÖ Solve classic benchmark problems (OR-Library, JSON)
- üß† Built-in solvers:
  - Tabu Search (TS)
  - Simulated Annealing (SA)
  - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
  - Q-Learning
  - DQN (with and without replay buffer)
  - Neuroevolution
- üìä Beautiful convergence and Gantt chart visualizations
- ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning support out-of-the-box
- üß™ Designed for research, education, and real-world production scheduling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install MetaForge

```bash
pip install metaforge
```

Or for local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mageed-Ghaleb/MetaForge.git
cd MetaForge
pip install -e .
```

---

### 2. Run a Solver (Example)

```python
from metaforge.problems.benchmark_loader import load_job_shop_instance
from metaforge.metaforge_runner import run_solver

problem = load_job_shop_instance("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mageed-Ghaleb/MetaForge/main/data/benchmarks/ft06.txt")
result = run_solver("ts", problem, track_schedule=True)

print("Best Makespan:", result["makespan"])
```

---

### 3. Visualize the Final Schedule

```python
from metaforge.utils.visualization import plot_gantt_chart

schedule = result["schedules"][-1]
plot_gantt_chart(schedule, num_machines=problem.num_machines, num_jobs=len(problem.jobs))
```
